# Lab 2 : Flashcard App (Unobliviate)

### App Description
This app displays a question and the user can click on the question to reveal the answer and when they wish to switch back to the question they can click on the answer again and can do this repeatedly. The user can also add their own flash cards in order to be able to diversify in their questions.
